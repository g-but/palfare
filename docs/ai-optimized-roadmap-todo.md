## 🤖 AI AGENT WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

### Daily Workflow:
1. **Check IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** - Always start here
2. **Update status** - Mark completed items as ✅
3. **Prioritize** - Focus on P0 (Critical) first, then P1 (High)
4. **Document changes** - Update this file with progress (automated via .cursorrules)
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure no regressions

### Status Indicators:
- ✅ **DONE** - Completed and verified
- 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Currently working on
- ❌ **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed (needs resolution)
- 📋 **PLANNED** - Ready to start
- ⏸️ **PAUSED** - Temporarily stopped

### Priority Levels:
- **P0 (Critical)** - Blocking issues, fix immediately
- **P1 (High)** - Important features, complete within sprint
- **P2 (Medium)** - Nice to have, schedule when capacity allows
- **P3 (Low)** - Future considerations

### Update Protocol:
1. **Before starting work:** Update status to 🔄
2. **After completing work:** Update status to ✅
3. **If blocked:** Update status to ❌ and document blocker
4. **Always update Last Modified date and summary** (enforced by .cursorrules)

## 📋 CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### **RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTION: Verify Cache Clear Fix (P0 - Critical)**

**Why this recommendation:**
1. **Cache Issues Resolved:** Cleared .next directory to eliminate module conflicts
2. **Low Risk:** Cache clearing is safe and often resolves import issues
3. **High Impact:** Should resolve the Button.tsx vs button.tsx conflicts
4. **Quick Validation:** Can verify success in next 2-3 minutes

**Specific Next Steps:**
1. Wait for server restart to complete (in progress)
2. Test critical pages (/people, /projects, /)
3. Verify clean console with no module warnings
4. Mark critical server fixes as complete if successful

**Alternative Options:**
- **Option B:** Start code quality fixes (can begin once server verified)
- **Option C:** Begin association system work (blocked until server stable)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Immediate (next 5 min):** Verify server functionality after cache clear
2. **Short-term (next 1 hour):** Begin code quality improvements
3. **Medium-term (next 2-4 hours):** Start association system work

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ All critical pages load successfully
- ✅ No more 500 server errors
- ✅ Clean console with no import/module conflicts
- ✅ Ready to proceed with feature development
