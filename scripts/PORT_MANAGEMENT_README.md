# Port Management Utilities

## Problem
Sometimes Node.js development servers don't terminate properly when you stop them (Ctrl+C), leaving processes running in the background. These hanging processes occupy ports 3000-3010, preventing new dev servers from starting.

## Solution

### Quick Commands

1. **Kill hanging processes:**
   ```bash
   npm run kill-ports
   ```

2. **Start dev server with cleanup:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:clean
   ```

3. **Start dev server on specific port:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:port
   # This runs on port 3020 to avoid conflicts
   ```

### Batch Scripts

- `scripts/kill-dev-processes.bat` - Interactive script to kill Node.js processes
- `scripts/dev-with-cleanup.bat` - Automatically cleans up and starts dev server

### Best Practices

1. **Always use Ctrl+C properly** to stop the dev server
2. **If Ctrl+C doesn't work**, close the terminal window completely
3. **Before starting dev server**, run `npm run kill-ports` if you suspect hanging processes
4. **Use `npm run dev:clean`** instead of `npm run dev` if you frequently have port conflicts

### Troubleshooting

If you still have port conflicts:

1. Check what's using the ports:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   ```

2. Kill specific process by PID:
   ```bash
   powershell "Stop-Process -Id [PID] -Force"
   ```

3. Kill all Node.js processes:
   ```bash
   npm run kill-ports
   ```

### Why This Happens

- Improper termination of dev servers
- System crashes while dev server is running
- Multiple terminal sessions running dev servers
- Background processes that didn't clean up properly
