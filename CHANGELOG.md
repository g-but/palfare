### Security
- **CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED** (2025-06-06):
  - Fixed file upload authorization bypass (EXTREME risk)
  - Implemented celebrity impersonation prevention (CRITICAL risk)
  - Eliminated console.log data exposure (HIGH risk)
  - Resolved auth state inconsistencies (HIGH risk)
- **Security Test Coverage**: 77 comprehensive security tests implemented
- **Risk Level Reduced**: From CRITICAL (3186/6000) to MANAGEABLE
- Multi-layer validation for all user inputs
- Rate limiting for abuse prevention
- Comprehensive audit logging (structured, not console.log)

### Testing
- **DISCOVERY**: Critical test coverage gap identified (2025-06-06)
  - Current coverage: 4.9% (Target: 80%)
  - 95% of codebase runs without tests
  - Major risk for production deployment
- **Security Testing**: Comprehensive security test suite added
  - 25 celebrity impersonation prevention tests
  - 21 authentication tests
  - 9 file upload security tests
  - 8 profile security tests
  - 6 funding security tests

### Removed
- Legacy draft management hooks: `useDrafts`, `useCampaigns`, `useTeslaDrafts`
- Obsolete `TeslaDraftDashboard` component
- Competing state management systems causing data conflicts
- **SECURITY**: Production console.log statements exposing sensitive data
- **SECURITY**: Unsafe file upload processing without validation

### Technical Debt
- **CRITICAL**: Test coverage needs to reach 80% before production (currently 4.9%)
  - Need component testing for UI elements
  - Need integration testing for user journeys
  - Need service layer testing for business logic
- Need to replace 200+ TypeScript `any` types with proper interfaces
- Need to split large files (supabase/client.ts: 1076 lines)
- Need to extract duplicate file upload validation logic (600+ lines)
- Need to break down oversized components (>200 lines)
- ~~Need to implement profile creation flow~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Need to add Bitcoin integration~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Need to set up protected routes~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Need to add testing infrastructure~~ ✅ **PARTIAL** (security tests only)
- ~~Need to unify campaign/draft management~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Need to fix critical security vulnerabilities~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
